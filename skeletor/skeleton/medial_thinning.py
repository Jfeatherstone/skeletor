Implements --  or rather, wraps (`scipy`'s implementation)[https://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/auto_examples/edges/plot_skeleton.html]
with some pre- and postprocessing -- the \( L_1 \) medial axis thinning algorithm described in Lee
et al. (1994). This algorithm works on either 2D or 3D point clouds.

This method is one of the oldest in the field, and other than being easy
to apply, doesn't have many advantages compared to modern methods.

Typical Applications
--------------------
1. Simple, solid objects, eg. the objects in the original paper or (scipy's manual page)[https://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/auto_examples/edges/plot_skeleton.html].
2. Objects without holes or gaps, since this method doesn't do any sort of interpolation/prediction.

Overview of Method
------------------
1. Convert an unordered set of points into a 2D or 3D image. For more
    information, see `skeletor.utils.pointsToImage()`.
2. Identify pixels or voxels that are on the edge of a feature.
3. Remove pixels or voxels from the previous step sequentially to
    preserve connectivity as best as possible.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until no more pixels or voxels can be removed.
5. Convert the skeletonized image into a set of points and an adjacency
    matrix denoting which points are neighbors.

Parameters
----------
This method only requires two parameters, which control how the set of points is turned into an image
during preprocessing.

`imageMaxDim` is the length of the largest side of the image in pixels/voxels.

`kernelSize` is the size of the blur kernel applied when registering points in the image.

The actual skeletonization of the resultant image has no free parameters.
